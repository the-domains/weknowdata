How to take athlete kitting out process from one of the best
known sporting bodies in the world and make it engaging and simple to run.

Transforming an athlete experience

For all large events, TeamGB kit-out thousands of athletes.
TeamGB recognised that by using their excel & paper-based system it lacked
athlete engagement, caused unnecessary delays and lacked any high-level
information e.g. KPI on time from athlete entry to exiting the process.

Seamless integration with brand

A worldwide National Olympic Committee deserves a
world-class application and our design team did exactly that. We worked closely
with the client to understand how they wanted to transform their kitting out
process. 

We decided it had to: present the TeamGB brand consistently
throughout the app from all user portals; use step guided flows to break down
large amounts of complex processes in an engaging way, and enhance the user
experience with tailored portals for the each job in the process.

Empowering the volunteer

The development team used all their knowledge and innovation
to push the boundaries of what was possible and created something truly
innovative and practical. Now the process can be taught to new volunteers in
less than half an hour by guiding the volunteers through the process they are
assigned.
